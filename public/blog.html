                                            We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational
                                            way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup
                                            questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject
                                            inappropriate requests.Methods:
                                            We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
                                            (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructGPT, but with slight differences
                                            in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised
                                            fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played
                                            both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to
                                            model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed
                                            this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed
                                            into a dialogue format.
                                            To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect
                                            comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by
                                            quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had
                                            with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled
                                            several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these
                                            reward models, we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy
                                            Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process.
