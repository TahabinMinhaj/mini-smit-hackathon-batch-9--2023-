                            <p>Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of
                                multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use
                                of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background
                                noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages,
                                as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models
                                and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for
                                further research on robust speech processing.</p>

                            <p>Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report
                                from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an
                                Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.
                                Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on
                                the side of the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or
                                program when you press it without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of
                                the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, beginning a workout and turning
                                on your flashlight.</p>
